# Airstrip Management System

The **Airstrip Management System** is a Rust-based application designed to manage airstrip operations effectively. It leverages Internet Computer (IC) technology for stable memory storage and provides functionalities for managing airstrips, scheduling flights, registering pilots, and scheduling maintenance operations.

## Features

### 1. Airstrip Management
- **Add new airstrips** with details like location, runway length, and capacity.
- Manage multiple airstrips efficiently.

### 2. Flight Scheduling
- Schedule flights with details such as flight number, destination, departure, and arrival times.
- Track the status of flights (`scheduled`, `delayed`, `completed`).

### 3. Pilot Management
- Register new pilots with their license details and years of experience.
- Maintain contact and email details for pilots.

### 4. Maintenance Scheduling
- Schedule maintenance tasks for airstrips.
- Track the status of maintenance tasks (`scheduled`, `completed`).

### 5. Performance and Scalability
- Optimized data storage using stable memory structures for long-term persistence.
- Designed for high performance to handle multiple airstrips and operations concurrently.


## Requirements
* rustc 1.64 or higher
```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```
* rust wasm32-unknown-unknown targetz
```bash
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
* candid-extractor
```bash
$ cargo install candid-extractor
```
* install `dfx`
```bash
$ DFX_VERSION=0.15.0 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
$ echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"' >> "$HOME/.bashrc"
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ dfx start --background
```

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
$ cd icp_rust_boilerplate/
$ dfx help
$ dfx canister --help
```

## Update dependencies

update the `dependencies` block in `/src/{canister_name}/Cargo.toml`:
```
[dependencies]
candid = "0.9.9"
ic-cdk = "0.11.1"
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
ic-stable-structures = { git = "https://github.com/lwshang/stable-structures.git", branch = "lwshang/update_cdk"}
```

## did autogenerate

Add this script to the root directory of the project:
```
https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno/blob/main/scripts/did.sh
```

Update line 16 with the name of your canister:
```
https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno/blob/main/scripts/did.sh#L16
```

After this run this script to generate Candid.
Important note!

You should run this script each time you modify/add/remove exported functions of the canister.
Otherwise, you'll have to modify the candid file manually.

Also, you can add package json with this content:
```
{
    "scripts": {
        "generate": "./did.sh && dfx generate",
        "gen-deploy": "./did.sh && dfx generate && dfx deploy -y"
      }
}
```

and use commands `npm run generate` to generate candid or `npm run gen-deploy` to generate candid and to deploy a canister.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
$ dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
$ dfx deploy
```
